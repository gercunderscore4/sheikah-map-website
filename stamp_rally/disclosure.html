I'm not affiliated with Anime North, just a cosplayer.<br>
(I'm the guy in the purple bunny outfit, there is no separate stamp guy.)<br>
I have their tentative permission to run this small side quest.<br>
This is based on the stamp rally side quest in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom.<br>
The prizes are resource items I've made from the game (like the monster fang).<br>
I can only make so many, sorry if I run out.<br>
I'm hoping no one destroys or steals the stands.<br>
And hopefully modge-podged cardboard stands will survive the rain.<br>
If you get all the stamps, you'll have seen where I am.<br>
The stamp stands and my (fake) shop will be open from opening time until about sundown each day.<br>
Please be nice, keep the stamp pads closed when not in use, help each other out, and have fun.<br>

Most stamp pads are near places where people use their Purah Pads.<br>
